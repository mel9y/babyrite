## Hold up!

babyrite is under development to rave reviews!

Docker support is already provided in #9, so you can build on the `main` branch, and the GitHub Container Registry has already pushed a Canary (under-development version), which can be obtained with a `docker pull`

However, the build is very unstable and may not work the way you expect it to,  We recommend that you wait until the official beta version (2023.1.rc1) is available on the [Release Page](https://github.com/m2en/babyrite/releases)

Development Kanban and timelines are managed by m2en's Notion

The official beta release of 2023.1.rc1 is scheduled for March or later (not finalized as it will be developed slowly... Sorry)

Please check the babyrite Timeline for more information
